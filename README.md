# CSS :hover Pseudo-class Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes tricky CSS bug involving the `:hover` pseudo-class not functioning as expected. The issue is that the hover styles are not applied when the mouse cursor interacts with the targeted element, even when other styling is working correctly.  This can be caused by several factors, including incorrect z-index, parent element issues, or JavaScript interference.

## Bug Description

The primary problem is the `:hover` state not triggering on a specific HTML element, causing a lack of visual feedback upon mouseover. This can lead to a poor user experience and usability issues.

## Bug Solution

The solution might involve adjusting the z-index of the element, addressing parent element issues like `pointer-events`, or disabling any JavaScript that might be preventing the event from triggering. This repository provides example code illustrating the problematic CSS and the correct solution, enabling developers to readily understand and resolve the issue.
